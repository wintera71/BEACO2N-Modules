[Fernando Perez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez), a professor in the Statistics department here at UC Berkeley, created [IPython](https://ipython.org/) as a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded [Project Jupyter](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/project-jupyter) in 2014.\n",

Other notebook interfaces have been released since then, but none have gained as much traction as Jupyter Notebooks have. Starting in the early 2000s, open-source scientific tools were becoming more and more popular and with the widespread popularity of Jupyter, it's well on its way to becoming a standard for sharing research methodology and results."
